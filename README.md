# Retro-Backup-Script
## Bash script that will find save and state files and copy them up to a backups directory.

##### Designed around the 353V Device with ArkOS. The filepaths are hardcoded to look for roms2/

*Currently this script will automatically overwrite any files that are in the backupsav directory*

Please make sure to offload the backupsavs folder to another location, such as a cloud location.
