# Retro-Backup-Script
## Bash script that will find save and state files and copy them up to a backups directory.

Designed around the 353V Device with ArkOS. The filepaths are hardcoded to look for roms2/

Make sure to set this as executable before using. 

**Please make sure to offload the backupsavs folder to another location, such as a cloud storage location.**

Dev Branch is to mess with the script to add experimental features.

**Dev Branch can/will/probably break the script. Be careful with using the script in the dev branch. You are responsible for your own data. **
